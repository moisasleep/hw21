Analysis Overview: The goal of this analysis is to construct a neural network-based deep learning model capable of predicting the success of funding applicants for a charitable organization. By analyzing historical data regarding funding applicants, the objective is to develop a model that can accurately classify whether a new applicant will be successful using various input features.
Data Preprocessing:
* Target Variable: The target variable for the model is likely to be 'STATUS'.
* Feature Variables: The model will include various attributes of the funding applicants, such as application type, classification, and other relevant factors influencing funding success.
* Variable Removal: Any variables that are not targets or features should be eliminated from the input data to minimize noise in the model. Also, all string variables need to be removed.
Model Compilation, Training, and Evaluation:
* Neurons, Layers, and Activation Functions: The neural network model employs three layers and a moderate amount of data to initiate the training process.
Achieving Target Model Performance:
* The success of the model hinges on factors like data quality, model architecture, and hyperparameter tuning. Attaining the desired model performance may require iterative experimentation and parameter adjustments.
Steps to Enhance Model Performance:
* Techniques such as adjusting neuron and layer counts, hyperparameter optimization, and regularization can enhance model performance. Feature engineering, data augmentation, and exploring different model architectures are also beneficial.
* Furthermore, it's recommended to explore alternative model types like gradient boosting machines or ensemble methods, as they could offer insights and enhance predictive performance. Analyzing feature importance and conducting sensitivity analysis may provide additional insights into the drivers of funding success.
In summary, the developed deep learning model aims to predict funding applicant success based on historical data. Achieving the target performance level requires some experimentation and fine-tuning. Exploring different model types and conducting further analysis on feature importance and sensitivity could offer valuable insights and enhance predictive accuracy.
